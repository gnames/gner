# entity

This is the innermost layer of Clean Architechture.

Entities encapsulate Enterprise wide business rules. An entity can be an object
with methods, or it can be a set of data structures and functions. It doesnâ€™t
matter so long as the entities could be used by many different applications in
the enterprise.

Entities must not depend on anything else in the project.
